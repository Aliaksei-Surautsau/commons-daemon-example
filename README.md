commons-daemon-example
======================

	Version: ${project.version}
	
A fairly simple project to demonstrate the awesomeness of the Apache Commons
Daemon project. This project demonstrates a complete application which 
can be run in the foreground, or (more importantly) as a background daemon
service using `jsvc`.
